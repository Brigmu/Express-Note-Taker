# Express-Note-Taker
An app that has an express backend that allows users to enter notes

# Description
This app allows users to create, save, and view notes that get saved serverside using the express package to handle the backend. This app is hosted on heroku to give users access to the database file and notes on different machines.  This project uses read-file and write-file to write a json-style database file that contains all of the info for the notes input by the user.

As a project this was very straightforward and simple for me to accomplish.  The biggest complexity to figure out and keep track of was the note ids and keeping them at the right numbers when notes were added or deleted.

# Installation
No installation required, simply a web browser is a required

# Usage
Navigate to [Heroku site](https://still-fjord-58184.herokuapp.com/) and click get started. Saved notes will be saved on the left of the screen. Click on them to view saved notes. To make a new note, give it a title, and then type the note and click save in the top right of the screen.
